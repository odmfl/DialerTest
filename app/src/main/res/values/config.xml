    <!-- Audio source for call recording:
         The service uses VOICE_CALL (4) on Android 10+ (API 29+) through InCallService
         to capture actual call audio (both sides). This works because the app is registered
         as an InCallService in AndroidManifest.xml.
         
         For Android 9 and below, this config value is used:
         1 (MIC) for microphone audio source - works on all devices but may only record one side
         6 (VOICE_RECOGNITION) for voice recognition - alternative for non-system apps
         
         Note: The service implements automatic runtime fallback if audio source fails:
         - Android 10+: Tries VOICE_CALL first (captures both sides of call)
         - Android 9 and below: Tries this config value (MIC by default)
         - If primary source fails: Falls back to VOICE_RECOGNITION, then MIC
