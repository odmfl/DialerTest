    <!-- Audio source for call recording:
         1 (MIC) for microphone audio source - works on all devices but may only record one side
         6 (VOICE_RECOGNITION) for voice recognition - best for non-system apps on Android 9+
         7 (VOICE_COMMUNICATION) for voice communication - works on some Android 10+ devices
         4 (VOICE_CALL) if supported by device - requires system privileges, not recommended
         
         Note: The service now implements automatic fallback:
         - Android 12+: VOICE_RECOGNITION (best compatibility)
         - Android 10-11: VOICE_COMMUNICATION
         - Android 9 and below: Uses this config value (MIC by default)
         - If any source fails, automatically falls back to VOICE_RECOGNITION then MIC
